1. In previous txt files, we did crud operations all using sql scripts.

2. We can also do so by using JAVA code directly, with JPA or Hibernate
annotations.

3. This method is good only for development and testing purposes, not on
enterprise levels because all data may be lost if not properly done.

4. In application.properties
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create

    //it will drop tables and create them on running the application
    //based on the annotations in Java code

    //we created entity student with table name, rows, columns, getters, setters, constructors

    //when tables are dropped, all the database is lost.
