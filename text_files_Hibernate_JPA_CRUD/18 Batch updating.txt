1. To set all last names to Poudel,
    int updatedRowsCount = entityManager.createQuery(
        "UPDATE Student SET lastName='Poudel'"
    ).executeUpdate();

    //ACTUALLY, executeUpdate() returns number of rows that were updated!
    note: i forgot @Transactional this time as well which led to error during runtime, not during
    compilation, so never forget to use that annotation during modifying of database.
