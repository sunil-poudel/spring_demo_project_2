1. We didn't use SELECT in previous .txt files, because
    Hibernate implementation is lenient (not strict) and
    allows HQL (Hibernate Query Language)

2. For strict JPA, SELECT clause is required.

3. E.g.
    TypedQuery<Student> theQuery = entityManager.createQuery(
        //  SELECT s FROM Student s WHERE s.email LIKE 'sunil%'
        // SELECT s FROM Student s WHERE s.lastName = ;theLastName
        // SELECT s FROM Student s
        , Student.class
    );
    where, s is identification variable/alias, used to reference
    Student entity object, useful for complex queries.
